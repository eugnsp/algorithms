# UVA solutions

These are my solutions of UVA problems from <http://uva.onlinejudge.org>.
A few notes are necessary:

1. To isolate the main idea of a solution, almost all solutions are split into three stages: (1) read input data into the operating memory with some preprocessing, (2) apply the main algorithm, (3) output the result.

2. Similar problems are solved using different algorithms and data structures &mdash; sometimes using those provided by the STL, sometimes using my own ones.

3. Input data is assumed to be always correct, `assert`s in the code are quite sporadic and not exhaustive.
