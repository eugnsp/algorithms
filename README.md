# Competitive programming solutions

These are my C++ solutions of some competitive programming problems. Similar problems are solved using
different algorithms and data structures &mdash; sometimes using those provided by the Standard library,
sometimes using my own ones.

Most solutions are in C+11 due to UVa online-judge limitation. Some of them after successful submission
were modified to use C++14/17 features.
