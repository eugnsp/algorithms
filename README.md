# Competitive programming solutions

These are my solutions of some competitive programming problems.

A few notes:

* To isolate the main idea of a solution, almost all solutions are split into three stages:
	1. read input data into the operating memory with some preprocessing,
	2. apply the main algorithm,
	3. output the result.
* Similar problems are solved using different algorithms and data structures &mdash; sometimes using those provided by the STL, sometimes using my own ones.
* Input data is assumed to be always correct, `assert`s in the code are quite sporadic and not exhaustive.
